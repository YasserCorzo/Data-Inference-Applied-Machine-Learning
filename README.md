# Data-Inference-Applied-Machine-Learning

Description of coursework:
Coursework involves using methods required to utilize data and quantitative models to automate predictive analytics and make improved decisions. From descriptive statistics to data analysis to machine learning the coursework here demonstrates the process of collecting, cleaning, interpreting, transforming, exploring, analyzing and modeling data with the goal of extracting information, communicating insights and supporting decisionmaking. The advantages and disadvantages of linear, nonlinear, parametric, nonparametric and ensemble methods are discussed in the reports while also explaining the challenges of both supervised and unsupervised learning. Applications in the reports include visualization, clustering, ranking, pattern recognition, anomaly detection, data mining, classification, regression, forecasting and risk analysis.
